# First Java Project

This is the first project created using Java, designed to demonstrate basic concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and input/output. The purpose of this project is to provide a foundational understanding of Java programming and showcase the implementation of basic control structures and simple functions.

## Features

- **Increment and Decrement Operations**: Demonstrates the use of post-increment (`a++`) and pre-increment (`++a`) operators within loops and conditional statements.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Simple operations with floating-point numbers, along with rounding and output formatting.
- **Control Structures**: Usage of `if`, `else`, `switch`, and `while` loops to control program flow based on different conditions.
- **Handling User Input**: The program interacts with the user through the console, collecting input such as a name and age, and then outputting a personalized greeting.

## Technologies Used
**Java:** Programming language used for the project.
**Scanner class:** For handling user input."# FirstJavaProject"
